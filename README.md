# Anime-Recommendation
A Recommendation system specifically for anime. 


(https://www.kaggle.com/CooperUnion/anime-recommendations-database)

## Problem Statement:
>I'm in need of some anime series recommendations that are under 100 episodes. I'm fairly new to anime so I don't know the exact genre/type I'm looking for, although I have >enjoyed all that i have watched so far.
>Things Ive enjoyed about the ones I have seen and are particularly looking for are:
>- Good plot lines and twists (e.g Death note, Steins Gate)
>- Male protagonists that are strong overpowered but aren't entirely full of themselves (e.g Kirito from Sword Art Online, Rin from Ao no Exorcst, Roy Mustang from >FMA:Brotherhood)
>- Reasonably modern animation art
>- Fantasy, Supernatural, Action, Adventure
>Things I'm not really interested in unless highly recommended to watch:
>- Sports themed
>- High school as main theme
>- Vampires
>- Too much like real life
>- Too much mecha (Enjoyed Code Geass)
>- Too much ecchi (Enjoyed Elfin Lied)
>Suggestions much appreciated :)








The main objective of this project is to recommend similar anime to the end users by using techniques like Collobrative filtering. Since we dont have that much of an information about the user or anime ,solving this problem using Content Based filtering is a little bit difficult.
